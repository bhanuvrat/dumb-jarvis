bootstrap a fresh linux installation

##Introduction
Thanks to the hardwork put in by the maintainers of various present-day linux distros, installing linux on a laptop is not the huge pain it used to be a few years ago. Though it gets installed and works right out of the box, the default configurations and pre-installed packages do not (and aren't even supposed to) match my requirements. And when setting up my new laptop or format the old one itself, I am unable to set everything up - either because of time constraints or plainly because a rarerly used but important package escapes my mind.  This is a humble attempt to document the entire setup and also script process that can be automated.
